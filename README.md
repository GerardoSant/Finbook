# Finbook - Fintech Webapp

This project consists of the development of the user environment
and the business logic of an application oriented to the management and visualization of
digital invoices for self-employed workers and SMEs, called ‘Finbook’

Finbook, by using digital invoices, automates functionalities and services that
nowadays must be done manually when dealing with physical invoices such as: the
generation, display, and comparison of financial statements in real time such as the
profit and loss report, the display of a dashboard with key indicators of the company’s
billing (income, expenses, benefits, payroll, etc.) or an invoice filer for searching,
downloading or mailing them.
